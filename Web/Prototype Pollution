Prototype-based Inheritance: In JavaScript, every object has a prototype, and when you create a new object, you can specify its prototype. Objects inherit properties and methods from their prototype. You can use the Object.create() method to create a new object with a specified prototype, or you can directly modify the prototype of an existing object using its prototype property.
Class-based Inheritance: JavaScript also supports classes, which provide a more familiar syntax for defining objects and inheritance. Classes in JavaScript are just syntactical sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance. Under the hood, classes still use prototypes.
