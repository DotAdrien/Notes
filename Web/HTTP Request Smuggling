Introduction to CL.TE request smuggling
CL.TE stands for Content-Length/Transfer-Encoding. The name CL.TE comes from the two headers involved: Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding. In CL.TE technique, the attacker exploits discrepancies between how different servers (typically a front-end and a back-end server) prioritize these headers. For example:

The proxy uses the Content-Length header to determine the end of a request.
The back-end server uses the Transfer-Encoding header.

Because of this discrepancy, it's possible to craft ambiguous requests that are interpreted differently by each server. For example, Imagine sending a request with both Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers. The front-end server might use the Content-Length header and think the request ends at a certain point due to the provided number of bytes. In contrast, the back-end server, relying on the Transfer-Encoding header, might interpret the request differently, leading to unexpected behaviour.

Exploiting CL.TE for Request Smuggling
To exploit the CL.TE technique, an attacker crafts a request that includes both headers, ensuring that the front-end and back-end servers interpret the request boundaries differently. For example, an attacker sends a request like:

Sample Request
POST /search HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Length: 130
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

POST /update HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Length: 13
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

isadmin=true
Here, the front-end server sees the Content-Length of 130 bytes and believes the request ends after  isadmin=true. However, the back-end server sees the Transfer-Encoding: chunked and interprets the 0 as the end of a chunk, making the second request the start of a new chunk. This can lead to the back-end server treating the POST /update HTTP/1.1 as a separate, new request, potentially giving the attacker unauthorized access.


Introduction to TE.CL Technique
TE.CL stands for Transfer-Encoding/Content-Length. This technique is the opposite of the CL.TE method. In the TE.CL approach, the discrepancy in header interpretation is flipped because the front-end server uses the Transfer-Encoding header to determine the end of a request, and the back-end server uses the Content-Length header.

The TE.CL technique arises when the proxy prioritizes the Transfer-Encoding header while the back-end server prioritizes the Content-Length header.

Example: If an attacker sends a request with both headers, the front-end server or proxy might interpret the request based on the Transfer-Encoding header, while the back-end server might rely on the Content-Length header. This difference in interpretation might interpret the request differently, leading to unexpected behaviour.

Exploiting TE.CL for Request Smuggling
To exploit the TE.CL technique, an attacker crafts a specially designed request that includes both the Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length headers, aiming to create ambiguity in how the front-end and back-end servers interpret the request.

For example, an attacker sends a request like:

Sample Request
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

78
POST /update HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 15

isadmin=true
0
In the above payload, the front-end server sees the Transfer-Encoding: chunked header and processes the request as chunked. The 78 (hexadecimal for 120) indicates that the next 120 bytes are part of the current request's body. The front-end server considers everything up to the 0 (indicating the end of the chunked message) as part of the body of the first request.

The back-end server, however, uses the Content-Length header, which is set to 4. It processes only the first 4 bytes of the request, not including the entire smuggled request POST /update. The remaining part of the request, starting from POST /update, is then interpreted by the back-end server as a separate, new request.

The smuggled request is processed by the back-end server as if it were a legitimate, separate request. This request includes the isadmin=true parameter, which could potentially elevate the attacker's privileges or alter data on the server, depending on the application's functionality.

Introduction to TE.TE Technique
Transfer Encoding Obfuscation, also known as TE.TE stands for Transfer-Encoding/Transfer-Encoding. Unlike the CL.TE or TE.CL methods, the TE.TE technique arises when both the front-end and the back-end servers use the Transfer-Encoding header. In TE.TE technique, the attacker takes advantage of the servers' inconsistent handling of  Transfer-Encoding present in the HTTP headers.

The TE.TE vulnerability doesn't always require multiple Transfer-Encoding headers. Instead, it often involves a single, malformed Transfer-Encoding header that is interpreted differently by the front-end and back-end servers. In some cases, the front-end server might ignore or strip out the malformed part of the header and process the request normally, while the back-end server might interpret the request differently due to the malformed header, leading to request smuggling.



Example: An attacker manipulates the Transfer-Encoding header by including "chunked" in malformed variations. This is done to exploit how front-end and back-end servers prioritize the Transfer-Encoding (TE) header over Content-Length (CL). By crafting malformed Transfer-Encoding headers, the attacker aims to make one server ignore the TE header and use CL instead, leading to a discrepancy in how the request boundaries are interpreted between the front-end and back-end servers. This manipulation can result in either a CL.TE or TE.CL situation, depending on which server falls back to using the Content-Length.

Exploiting TE.TE for Request Smuggling
To exploit the TE.TE technique, an attacker may craft a request that includes Transfer-Encoding headers that use different encodings. For example, an attacker sends a request like:

Sample Request
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Transfer-Encoding: chunked1

4e
POST /update HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-length: 15

isadmin=true
0
In the above payload, the front-end server encounters two Transfer-Encoding headers. The first one is a standard chunked encoding, but the second one, chunked1, is non-standard. Depending on its configuration, the front-end server might process the request based on the first Transfer-Encoding: chunked header and ignore the malformed chunked1, interpreting the entire request up to the 0 as a single chunked message.

The back-end server, however, might handle the malformed Transfer-Encoding: chunked1 differently. It could either reject the malformed part and process the request similarly to the front-end server or interpret the request differently due to the presence of the non-standard header. If it processes only the first 4 bytes as indicated by the Content-length: 4, the remaining part of the request starting from POST /update is then treated as a separate, new request.

The smuggled request with the isadmin=true parameter is processed by the back-end server as if it were a legitimate, separate request. This could lead to unauthorized actions or data modifications, depending on the server's functionality and the nature of the /update endpoint.

Assessing the Application
The web application for this room uses the link http://httprequestsmuggling.thm. It features a Home, Login, and Contact form that enables users to access and send feedback to the developer. For demonstration, the submitted queries are saved to the /submissions directory. Below is the screenshot of the application: 

Homepage of he vulnerable application


Exploiting the Application
Using Burp Suite Proxy, intercept a request sent to the website's index. This request will become the baseline we will use to exploit the vulnerable application.

Baseline request to be used for smuggling

Send the request to Intruder and copy-paste the below payload to the Payload positions box.

Payload
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: httprequestsmuggling.thm
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 160
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

POST /contact.php HTTP/1.1
Host: httprequestsmuggling.thm
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 500

username=test&query=§
Breakdown of the payload
In CL.TE vulnerability, since the proxy or the front-end prioritises the Content-Length header, 160 bytes of the body is assumed to be the body of the first POST. The front-end thinks this is a single request and forwards it into the pipeline, where the back-end server now prioritises Transfer-Encoding, ending the first POST request at the first 0 size chunk and assuming the second POST is a different request.
